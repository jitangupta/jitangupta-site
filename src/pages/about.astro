				I still remember the first time I deployed an app—excited, nervous, and praying it wouldn’t crash. A decade later, I’ve built
				enterprise-grade systems from scratch, tackled debugging nightmares, and migrated legacy software into scalable cloud solutions.

			<p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">
				I’m a <span class="font-semibold">full-stack engineer</span> who has been involved in every phase of software development—from writing
				the first line of code to deploying production-ready applications. But beyond the code, my real passion is <span class="font-semibold">teaching and mentoring</span>.
			</p>
			
			<p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">
				I love helping students, early-career developers, and IT professionals transitioning into tech. That’s why I write articles and break
				down complex topics into bite-sized, practical lessons that you can apply right away.
			</p>
			
			<p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">
				Now, I’m launching a <span class="font-semibold">YouTube channel</span> where I’ll share real-world coding challenges, architecture insights, and career hacks—everything I wish I had when I started.
