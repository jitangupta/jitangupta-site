## Client Background

Our client's credit management system allows students to receive academic credit for prior experience, including:

- Work experience
- Military service
- Prior learning

The platform serves three user groups:
- **Students** submitting portfolio credit requests with supporting documentation
- **Evaluators** assessing submissions and awarding appropriate credits
- **Administrators** managing the system

## The Challenge

The system faced several critical issues:

### Technical Limitations
- Three separate monolithic applications built on outdated .NET Framework
- Limited scalability with single-server deployment
- Poor mobile responsiveness

### Leadership Void
- Previous technical team departed, leaving knowledge gaps
- Minimal documentation
- Communication breakdowns between teams

### Business Impact
- Degraded student experience during peak periods
- Growing technical debt
- Inability to implement new features


## Solution Approach

We implemented a "Retire & Rebuild" strategy instead of refactoring:
### New Architecture:
- **Backend**: .NET Core 6 with a service-oriented architecture
- **Frontend**: Angular 14 providing responsive design across devices
- **Messaging**: Azure Service Bus with Azure Functions for notification processing
- **Hosting**: Azure App Services for improved scalability and reduced maintenance
- **Monitoring**: ELK stack implementation for comprehensive error logging and system health

The migration approach included parallel operation of both systems until the new platform demonstrated full capability—minimizing risk to academic operations while enabling incremental validation of the new system.

## Technical Implementation

The technical transformation focused on several key architectural improvements:

### From Monolith to Service-Oriented Architecture
The three separate monolithic applications were consolidated into a single platform with a service-oriented backend architecture. This approach:
- Eliminated code redundancy while preserving distinct user workflows
- Enabled independent scaling of high-demand services
- Facilitated more focused testing and deployment

### Cloud-Native Infrastructure
Moving from VM-based hosting to Azure App Services provided:
- Automatic scaling during peak enrollment periods
- Reduced infrastructure management overhead
- Enhanced security and compliance capabilities

### Modern User Experience
The Angular 14 frontend implementation delivered:
- Responsive design supporting desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- Improved accessibility for all users
- More intuitive workflow management

### Enhanced Observability
Implementation of the ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack enabled:
- Proactive error detection and resolution
- System performance monitoring and optimization

## Project Execution

Taking over leadership of the backend team required a systematic approach to understand, plan, and execute the migration while maintaining stakeholder confidence:

### 1. Analysis & Documentation
The first priority was creating comprehensive documentation of all existing functionality:
- Conducted knowledge transfer sessions with product managers
- Mapped user journeys for all three user types (Students, Evaluators, Administrators)
- Documented module dependencies and integration points
- Created a functional baseline to ensure complete feature coverage

### 2. Strategic Work Distribution
With documentation in place, we:
- Broke down functionality into discrete, manageable tasks
- Prioritized development to enable parallel frontend development
- Established clear acceptance criteria for each component
- Created a development roadmap with measurable milestones

### 3. Stakeholder Alignment
To rebuild confidence in the project:
- Presented the comprehensive documentation and work plan to key stakeholders
- Established regular progress reviews and demonstration sessions
- Implemented transparent progress tracking and reporting

### 4. Parallel Execution & Team Leadership
Leading the backend team required balancing multiple responsibilities:
- Continued documentation and analysis of remaining modules
- Conversion of requirements into actionable development tasks
- Direct development of core architectural components
- Cross-team coordination with frontend developers

Within three weeks of implementing this approach, the project showed demonstrable progress with functioning APIs supporting initial frontend development, rebuilding stakeholder confidence in the migration initiative.

## Results and Business Impact

The modernization initiative delivered significant technical and business benefits:

### Enhanced User Experience
- **40% improvement in system usability** based on user satisfaction metrics
- Responsive design extended platform access across all device types
- Streamlined workflows reduced time needed to submit and evaluate credit requests

### Technical Improvements
- **Auto-scaling infrastructure** eliminated performance issues during peak enrollment periods
- Consolidated codebase reduced maintenance overhead and simplified future enhancements
- Cloud-native architecture reduced infrastructure costs while improving reliability

### Business Outcomes
- Expanded reach to mobile users increased potential student engagement
- Improved evaluator efficiency reduced credit processing times
- Enhanced system reliability built greater confidence in the credit evaluation process
- Modern architecture enabled faster implementation of new academic policies and requirements

## Lessons Learned

The successful migration revealed several key insights applicable to similar modernization initiatives:

- **Documentation First**
Ensures coverage, clarity, and alignment

- **Modular Migration Works**
Enables parallel teams and risk mitigation

- **Leadership Multiplies Impact**
Architecture, people, and communication all matter

- **Rebuild > Refactor (in the right context)**
Cleaner, scalable architecture without legacy baggage

## Conclusion

Through strategic leadership and thoughtful execution, we transformed a brittle legacy platform into a modern cloud-native system. The result is a faster, scalable, and more accessible experience—empowering students, staff, and future innovations alike.
