# CLAUDE.md — Website Update Task for jitangupta.com

## Context

Jitan has discovered his authentic purpose: **He is a guide who transmits understanding so that others can build better careers and lives.**

He's creating YouTube content (in Hinglish) to teach engineers about Cloud, Kubernetes, and AI — starting with his own team members and expanding from there.

**The website needs to reflect this shift:**
- From: "Enterprise Migration Expert" (consulting positioning)
- To: "Cloud & AI Guide" (teacher/mentor positioning)

---

## Current Site Structure (White Theme)

Based on the current design:
- **Nav:** Migration Approach | Case Studies | Get a Free Strategy Call
- **Hero:** "Migrate Legacy Systems Without Downtime" + consulting CTA
- **Section:** "How Can I Help You?" (consulting services)
- **Section:** Case Studies (4 projects)
- **Footer:** "Enterprise Migration Expert" + strategy call CTA

---

## Target Transformation

The site should communicate:
> "I help engineers understand Cloud, Kubernetes, and AI through real-world experience. I teach what I've built."

---

## Specific Changes

### 1. Navigation

**Current:** `Migration Approach | Case Studies | Get a Free Strategy Call`

**Update to:** `Learn | Case Studies | About | Contact`

- "Learn" → links to new learning section or /learn page (primary focus)
- "Case Studies" → keep (builds credibility)
- Remove "Migration Approach" from main nav (or move to footer)
- "Get a Free Strategy Call" → change to simple "Contact"

---

### 2. Hero Section

**Current:**
```

I help businesses move to scalable, cloud-native systems. This cuts costs, boosts performance, and eliminates technical debt.
✓ 10+ years in software, specializing in enterprise migrations.

```

**Update to:**
```
Learn Cloud, Kubernetes & AI
From Someone Who's Built It

I've spent 10 years building enterprise software and cloud infrastructure — migrations, multi-tenant systems, AI tools.

✓ Hinglish videos 🇮🇳 for Indian engineers (English dubs available)

[Start Learning] [See What I've Built]
```

**CTAs:**
- "Start Learning" → links to YouTube or /learn section
- "See What I've Built" → links to Case Studies

---

### 3. "How Can I Help You?" Section → Rename to "What You'll Learn"

**Current cards (consulting focus):**
- Cut Costs, Boost Performance
- Cloud-Native Done Right
- Secure & Future-Proof
- End-to-End Migration Strategy
- Business-First Tech Consulting

**Replace with learning roadmap cards:**

**Card 1: Cloud + Azure Fundamentals**
> The building blocks: Compute, Storage, Networking, Identity. Understand the "why" before the "how."
> [Coming Soon / Watch Now]

**Card 2: Azure Kubernetes (AKS)**
> Real migration patterns from VMs to Kubernetes. Multi-tenant architecture, YARP routing, GitOps with ArgoCD.
> [Coming Soon / Watch Now]

**Card 3: AI + RAG Systems**
> Building intelligent applications with Azure AI Foundry, vector databases, and retrieval-augmented generation.
> [Coming Soon / Watch Now]

**Card 4: Agents & Multi-Agent Systems**
> The frontier: orchestrating AI agents for complex workflows.
> [Coming Soon / Watch Now]

Use icons similar to current design (cloud, kubernetes wheel, AI chip, robot/agent).

---

### 4. Case Studies Section

**Keep as is** — these build credibility and show you've actually done the work.

**Optional tweak to heading:**
- Current: "Case Studies"
- Update to: "Real Projects I've Built" or "What I Teach From"

**Add subheading:**
> "Every lesson I share comes from something I've actually built. Here's the proof."

---

---

## Pages to Update/Create

### Homepage (/) — Primary changes above

### /learn (New Page)
Create a dedicated learning page with:
- The 4-part roadmap (Cloud → Kubernetes → AI → Agents)
- Embedded YouTube videos (once created)
- Clear progression path
- "Subscribe" CTA for YouTube

### /case-studies/ — Minor updates
- Update page intro to reference teaching angle
- Add "Watch me explain this" links once videos exist

### /about/ (if exists) — Update bio
Use the same content as the About/Footer section:
- 10 years building enterprise software and cloud infrastructure
- Multi-tenant Kubernetes, AI systems, identity platforms
- "Every engineer I've taught got into the industry"
- Current focus on teaching through videos and case studies

---

## Content Language

**YouTube videos:** Hinglish (Hindi + English) — natural, conversational
**Website:** English — but warm, approachable tone. Like explaining to a colleague.

**Mention on site:** "Videos in Hinglish 🇮🇳 | English dubs available"

---

## Voice & Tone

- Warm and approachable — senior colleague energy
- Confident but humble — "I've learned this, let me share"
- Practical — "patterns that work" not "best practices"
- Lead with credibility — real projects, real numbers
- Avoid: "guru", "expert", "master" — use "guide" instead

---

## Key Phrases to Use

- "I teach what I've lived, not what I've studied."
- "Every engineer I've taught got into the industry."
- "Building systems. Teaching engineers."
- "Real patterns from real systems."

Use sparingly. Let the work speak.

---

## Design Notes

- Keep the clean white theme — it's professional and readable
- Keep the orange accent color — works well for CTAs
- The current card layout works — just change the content
- Profile photo is good — friendly and approachable
- Consider adding YouTube video thumbnails to /learn page once content exists

---

## What NOT to Change

- Overall layout structure (it's clean)
- Case studies content (builds credibility)
- Color scheme (orange + white works)
- Profile photo
- Footer structure (just update links/text)

---

## Implementation Priority

1. **Hero section** — First impression, most important
2. **"How Can I Help You?" → "What You'll Learn"** — Core transformation
3. **About/Footer section** — Credibility + teaching angle
4. **Navigation** — Reflect new focus
5. **Meta/SEO** — Title and description
6. **Create /learn page** — Once YouTube content exists
7. **Link case studies to videos** — Once videos exist

---

## Success Criteria

When someone lands on jitangupta.com, they should think:
> "This person has real experience AND wants to help me learn. I want to watch his videos."

Not:
> "This is a consultant trying to sell me a strategy call."

## Notes for Claude Code

- Site is built with Astro
- Preserve existing styling and components where possible
- The white theme is the correct base — don't revert to dark
- Make incremental commits with clear messages
- Test locally before deployment
- Images are in appropriate directories — reuse existing icons where possible
