Based on your profile as a high-level Cloud & Platform Engineer specializing in Multi-tenant Kubernetes and AI Ops, here are three strategic suggestions to take your portfolio to the next level when you're ready.

Since you are selling "reliability" and "AI expertise," your site should actively demonstrate these qualities, not just state them.

1. "Eat Your Own Dogfood" (The Ultimate Proof)
You offer RAG-based AI tools as a service. The most powerful way to sell this is to demonstrate it live.

Suggestion: Add a minimal "Ask Jitan AI" chat interface in the bottom corner.
How it works: Train a small RAG model on your resume, project case studies, and architecture diagrams.
Why: When a potential client asks, "How do you handle multi-tenant isolation?" and your AI gives a perfect technical answer citing your specific experience, you've proved your competence before you even speak to them.
2. The "Engineering Blog" as a Trust Signal
You emphasize "Documentation & Handoff" as a key service. This is a major pain point for clients who fear vendor lock-in.

Suggestion: Don't just write generic blog posts. Write "Engineering Deep Dives" or "Post-Mortems."
Example Topics: "How we debugged a memory leak across 400 tenants" or "The architecture decision record (ADR) for choosing YARP over Nginx."
Why: This proves you write high-quality documentation and think deeply about architectural trade-offs, validating your third service pillar.
3. Low-Friction Lead Magnet
"Let's Talk" is a big commitment. Many potential clients are in the research phase.

Suggestion: Offer a high-value, downloadable asset like a "Multi-Tenant Kubernetes Architecture Blueprint" (a high-res PDF of the diagrams you just added, with annotated notes).
Why: It captures leads who are interested in your specific niche but aren't ready to book a call yet. It establishes you as the authority on that specific architecture.
